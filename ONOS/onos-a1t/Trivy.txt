On installations using SELinux, such as EL8 (CentOS, RHEL), Fedora, or SUSE MicroOS, with containerd since v1.5.0-beta.0 as the backing container runtime interface (CRI), an unprivileged pod scheduled to the node may bind mount, via hostPath volume, any privileged, regular file on disk for complete read/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing the in-container location of the hostPath volume mount at either `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations are being relabeled indiscriminately to match the container process-label which effectively elevates permissions for savvy containers that would not normally be able to access privileged host files. This issue has been resolved in version 1.5.9. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-281"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"nvd":4,"photon":4,"redhat":3,"ubuntu":1},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8.1},"nvd":{"V2Vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","V2Score":6,"V3Score":9.1},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-43816","https://github.com/containerd/containerd","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/a731039238c62be081eb8c31525b988415745eea","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/6194","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-mvff-h3cj-wj9c","https://github.com/dweomer/containerd/commit/f7f08f0e34fb97392b0d382e58916d6865100299","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GD5GH7NMK5VJMA2Y5CYB5O5GTPYMWMLX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MPDIZMI7ZPERSZE2XO265UCK5IWM7CID/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GD5GH7NMK5VJMA2Y5CYB5O5GTPYMWMLX","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MPDIZMI7ZPERSZE2XO265UCK5IWM7CID","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43816","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43816"],"PublishedDate":"2022-01-05T19:15:08.717Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-11-07T03:39:26.78Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-23648","PkgID":"github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.5.7","PkgName":"github.com/containerd/containerd","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@1.5.7","UID":"968c48862f657096"},"InstalledVersion":"1.5.7","FixedVersion":"1.4.13, 1.5.10, 1.6.1","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2022-23648","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"containerd: insecure handling of image volumes","Description":"containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows.

As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2},"References":["https://github.com/containerd/containerd","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/67d356cb3095f3e8f8ad7d36f9a733fea1e7e28c","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/746b910f05855c8bfdb4415a1c0f958b234910e5","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c"],"Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5j5w-g665-5m35","PkgID":"github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.5.7","PkgName":"github.com/containerd/containerd","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@1.5.7","UID":"968c48862f657096"},"InstalledVersion":"1.5.7","FixedVersion":"1.4.12, 1.5.8","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j5w-g665-5m35","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"Ambiguous OCI manifest parsing","Description":"### Impact\n\nIn the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior and in the OCI Image Specification version 1.0.1 and prior, manifest and index documents are ambiguous without an accompanying Content-Type HTTP header.

Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.\n\nThis bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.11 and 1.6.2.  Users should update to these versions as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.\n\nThis fix changes containerd behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io) if you think you\u2019ve found a security bug","Severity":"LOW","VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":1},"References":["https://github.com/containerd/containerd","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/e9af808591ee1468f9b0ad6a0d41fdf93ee0c1bc","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-c9cp-9c75-9v8c"],"Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6xv5-86q9-7xr8","PkgID":"github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin@v0.2.2","PkgName":"github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin@0.2.2","UID":"a80f3b003159d9a5"},"InstalledVersion":"0.2.2","FixedVersion":"0.2.4","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6xv5-86q9-7xr8","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"SecureJoin: on windows, paths outside of the rootfs could be inadvertently produced","Description":"### Impact\nFor Windows users of `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin`, until v0.2.4 it was possible for certain rootfs and path combinations (in particular, where a malicious Unix-style `/`-separated unsafe path was used with a Windows-style rootfs path) to result in generated paths that were outside of the provided rootfs.\n\nIt is unclear to what extent this has a practical impact on real users, but given the possible severity of the issue we have released an emergency patch release that resolves this issue.\n\nThanks to  @pjbgf for discovering, debugging, and fixing this issue (as well as writing some tests for it).\n\n### Patches\nc121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b is the patch fixing this issue. v0.2.4 contains the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers could use `filepath.FromSlash()` on all unsafe paths before passing them to `filepath-securejoin`.\n\n### References\nSee #9.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2},"References":["https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin","https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/commit/c121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b","https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pull/9","https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/releases/tag/v0.2.4","https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/security/advisories/GHSA-6xv5-86q9-7xr8"],"Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-41092","PkgID":"github.com/docker/cli@v20.10.7+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/cli","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/cli@20.10.7%2Bincompatible","UID":"1a08e42c65d407ff"},"InstalledVersion":"20.10.7+incompatible","FixedVersion":"20.10.9","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2021-41092","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"docker: cli leaks private registry credentials to registry-1.docker.io","Description":"Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container\u2019s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-420","CWE-636","CWE-203","CWE-755"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":3,"nvd":3,"redhat":3},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L","V3Score":7.5},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8.7},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H","V3Score":8.7}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-28840","https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333","https://github.com/moby/moby","https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382","https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYZOKMMVX4SIEHPJW3SJUQGMO5YZCPHC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XNF4OLYZRQE75EB5TW5N42FSXHBXGWFE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZTE4ITXXPIWZEQ4HYQCB6N6GZIMWXDAI/","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28840","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28840"],"PublishedDate":"2023-04-04T22:15:07.853Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-09-15T21:15:10.15Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-27534","PkgID":"github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/docker","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","UID":"380b10339db93f86"},"InstalledVersion":"17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","FixedVersion":"19.03.9","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2020-27534","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"moby/buildkit: calls os.OpenFile with a potentially unsafe qemu-check temporary pathname","Description":"util/binfmt_misc/check.go in Builder in Docker Engine before 19.03.9 calls os.OpenFile with a potentially unsafe qemu-check temporary pathname, constructed with an empty first argument in an ioutil.TempDir call.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"cbl-mariner":2,"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"photon":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V3Score":5.3},"nvd":{"V2Vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V2Score":5,"V3Score":5.3},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V3Score":5.3}},"References":["http://web.archive.org/web/20200530054359/https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes","http://web.archive.org/web/20200530054359/https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27534","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921154","https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/1462","https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/40877","https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#TempDir","https://golang.org/pkg/os/#TempDir","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27534","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27534"],"PublishedDate":"2020-12-30T23:15:15.297Z","LastModifiedDate":"2021-01-05T20:19:00.423Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-41091","PkgID":"github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/docker","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","UID":"380b10339db93f86"},"InstalledVersion":"17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","FixedVersion":"20.10.9","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2021-41091","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"moby: data directory contains subdirectories with insufficiently restricted permissions, which could lead to directory traversal","Description":"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization.

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-732"],"VendorSeverity":{"amazon":2,"cbl-mariner":2,"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"photon":2,"redhat":2,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","V3Score":5.9},"nvd":{"V2Vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","V2Score":4.6,"V3Score":5.9},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","V3Score":4.8}},"References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/05/12/1","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-24769","https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-c9cp-9c75-9v8c","https://github.com/moby/moby","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/2bbc786e4c59761d722d2d1518cd0a32829bc07f","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7f375bcff41ce672cd61e9a31f3eeb2966e3dbe1","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.14","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PMQKCAPK2AR3DCYITJYMMNBEGQBGLCC","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PMQKCAPK2AR3DCYITJYMMNBEGQBGLCC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5AFKOQ5CE3CEIULWW4FLQKHFFU6FSYG","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5AFKOQ5CE3CEIULWW4FLQKHFFU6FSYG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5FQJ3MLFSEKQYCFPFZIKYGBXPZUJFVY","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5FQJ3MLFSEKQYCFPFZIKYGBXPZUJFVY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FPOJUJZXGMIVKRS4QR75F6OIXNQ6LDBL","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FPOJUJZXGMIVKRS4QR75F6OIXNQ6LDBL/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HIMAHZ6AUIKN7AX26KHZYBXVECIOVWBH","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HIMAHZ6AUIKN7AX26KHZYBXVECIOVWBH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HQCVS7WBFSTKJFNX5PGDRARMTOFWV2O7","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HQCVS7WBFSTKJFNX5PGDRARMTOFWV2O7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PMQKCAPK2AR3DCYITJYMMNBEGQBGLCC","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5AFKOQ5CE3CEIULWW4FLQKHFFU6FSYG","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5FQJ3MLFSEKQYCFPFZIKYGBXPZUJFVY","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FPOJUJZXGMIVKRS4QR75F6OIXNQ6LDBL","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HIMAHZ6AUIKN7AX26KHZYBXVECIOVWBH","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HQCVS7WBFSTKJFNX5PGDRARMTOFWV2O7","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24769","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5776-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24769","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5162"],"PublishedDate":"2022-03-24T20:15:09.493Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-01-31T13:15:08.913Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-36109","PkgID":"github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/docker","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","UID":"380b10339db93f86"},"InstalledVersion":"17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","FixedVersion":"20.10.18","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2022-36109","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"moby: supplementary groups mishandling","Description":"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic at the Internet boundary in order to prevent unintentionally leaking unencrypted traffic over the Internet, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-311","CWE-636","CWE-755"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.8},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.8},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":6.8}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-28841","https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/d9fae4c73daf76c3b0f77e14b45b8bf612ba764d/drivers/overlay/encryption.go#L205-L207","https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333","https://github.com/moby/moby","https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382","https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYZOKMMVX4SIEHPJW3SJUQGMO5YZCPHC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XNF4OLYZRQE75EB5TW5N42FSXHBXGWFE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZTE4ITXXPIWZEQ4HYQCB6N6GZIMWXDAI/","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28841","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28841"],"PublishedDate":"2023-04-04T22:15:07.937Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-09-15T21:15:10.363Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-28842","PkgID":"github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/docker","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","UID":"380b10339db93f86"},"InstalledVersion":"17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","FixedVersion":"20.10.24, 23.0.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-28842","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"moby: Encrypted overlay network with a single endpoint is unauthenticated","Description":"Moby) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products.

The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-669"],"VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":5.9},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","V3Score":5.9}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29018","https://github.com/moby/moby","https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46609","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29018","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29018"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-20T21:15:31.113Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-03-21T12:58:51.093Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jq35-85cj-fj4p","PkgID":"github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/docker","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","UID":"380b10339db93f86"},"InstalledVersion":"17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","FixedVersion":"24.0.7, 23.0.8, 20.10.27","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jq35-85cj-fj4p","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"/sys/devices/virtual/powercap accessible by default to containers","Description":"Intel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments running directly on affected hardware. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":2},"References":["https://github.com/moby/moby","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/48ebe353e49a9def5e6679f6e386b0efb1c95f0e","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/81ebe71275768629689a23bc3bca34b3b374a6a6","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/c9ccbfad11a60e703e91b6cca4f48927828c7e35","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.27","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v23.0.8","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v24.0.7","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-jq35-85cj-fj4p"],"Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42","PkgID":"github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","PkgName":"github.com/docker/docker","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","UID":"380b10339db93f86"},"InstalledVersion":"17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","FixedVersion":"20.10.11","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"Moby (Docker Engine) is vulnerable to Ambiguous OCI manifest parsing","Description":"### Impact\nIn the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior and in the OCI Image Specification version 1.0.1 and prior, manifest and index documents are ambiguous without an accompanying Content-Type HTTP header.

Moby allows for building container images using a set of build instructions (usually named and referred to as a \"Dockerfile\"), and a build context, which is not unlike the CWD in which the Dockerfile instructions are executed.\n\nContainers may be built using a variety of tools and build backends available in the Moby ecosystem; in all cases, builds may not include files outside of the build context (such as using absolute or relative-parent paths). This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization of the build process itself.\n\nVersions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context, without any visible warning to the user.\n\nThis issue was originally reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving the root issue in Git.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability originates in Git, but can be used to violate assumptions that may have security implications for users of Moby and related components. Users may rely on the fact that a build context ensures that outside files cannot be referenced or incorporated using multiple enforcement mechanisms, or expect a warning if this does not hold true. A maliciously crafted Git repository exploiting CVE-2022-39253 can violate this assumption, and potentially include sensitive files that are subsequently uploaded to a container image repository, or disclosed by code inside the resulting container image.\n\nAs this issue cannot be triggered remotely, except by users who already have full control over the daemon through the API, and it requires exploiting a vulnerability in Git by convincing a user to build a maliciously crafted repository, the impact in Moby is considered low.\n\n### Patches\n\nMoby 20.10.20, and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Enterprise Edition) 20.10.14 will contain mitigations for CVE-2022-39253 when a Git clone is performed by Moby components (on either the daemon or API client side). However, as these mitigations only apply to certain scenarios (build of `git+<protocol>://...` URL contexts) and cannot protect against a malicious repository already on disk, users should update to a version of Git containing patches for CVE-2022-39253 on all their systems running both API clients and daemons.\n\nSpecifically, patches in Moby (including patches incorporated from BuildKit) protect against the following:\n\n* `docker build` with the legacy builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` unset or set to 0) of a Git URL context. Note that depending on available API versions and the CLI version, the Git clone operation can take place on either the client or the daemon side. Both must be updated (or have Git updated) to fully protect this build method.\n* `docker build` with the BuildKit builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`) of a Git URL context.\n* `docker buildx build` with `BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` of a Git URL context.\n\nPatches in BuildKit incorporated into Docker Compose protect against CVE-2022-39253 during Compose-driven builds of Git URL contexts.\n\nPatches in Moby and related projects such as BuildKit, the Docker CLI, and Docker Compose **cannot** fully protect against CVE-2022-39253, as it may be triggered by a malicious repository already on disk that a unpatched Git client has interacted with (specifically, commands that check out submodules such as `git clone --recursive`, `git submodule update`, etc.  may have already triggered the Git vulnerability).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhile this behavior is unexpected and undesirable, and has resulted in this security advisory, users should keep in mind that building a container entails arbitrary code execution. Users should not build a repository/build context they do not trust, as containerization cannot protect against all possible attacks.\n\nWhen building with BuildKit (e.g. `docker buildx build` or `docker build` with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`), this issue cannot be exploited unless `--build-arg BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` was also passed, as by default BuildKit will discard the `.git` directory of a Git URL context immediately after cloning and checking out the repository.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com)","Severity":"LOW","VendorSeverity":{"ghsa":1},"References":["https://github.blog/2022-10-17-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced","https://github.com/moby/moby","https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.20","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4jw1uku5.fsf@gitster.g/T/#u"],"Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-40083","PkgID":"github.com/labstack/echo/v4@v4.6.1","PkgName":"github.com/labstack/echo/v4","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/labstack/echo/v4@4.6.1","UID":"3aa138f676077f3c"},"InstalledVersion":"4.6.1","FixedVersion":"4.9.0","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2022-40083","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"Labstack Echo v4.8.0 was discovered to contain an open redirect vulner ...","Description":"Labstack Echo v4.8.0 was discovered to contain an open redirect vulnerability via the Static Handler component.

In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-190"],"VendorSeverity":{"alma":2,"cbl-mariner":2,"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"oracle-oval":2,"photon":2,"redhat":1},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","V3Score":6},"nvd":{"V2Vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","V2Score":6,"V3Score":5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","V3Score":5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6380","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-43784","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2029439","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2175721","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2178492","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2182883","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2182884","https://errata.almalinux.org/9/ALSA-2023-6380.html","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/dde509df4e28cec33b3c99c6cda3d4fd5beafc77","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f50369af4b571e358f20b139eea52d612eb55eed","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-43784.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-6380.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00005.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00005.html","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43784","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0274","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43784"],"PublishedDate":"2021-12-06T18:15:08.24Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-19T03:15:07.33Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-29162","PkgID":"github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.2","PkgName":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@1.0.2","UID":"2a37adddf18655bc"},"InstalledVersion":"1.0.2","FixedVersion":"1.1.2","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2022-29162","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"runc: incorrect handling of inheritable capabilities","Description":"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

(CVE-2023-44487)","Description":"A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer

DoS","Description":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","Severity":"MEDIUM","VendorSeverity":{"alma":3,"amazon":2,"cbl-mariner":3,"ghsa":2,"oracle-oval":3,"photon":3,"redhat":3,"rocky":3,"ubuntu":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","V3Score":5.3},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5}},"References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3346","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45288","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2268017","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2268018","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2268019","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2268273","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268017","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268018","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268019","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268273","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45288","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45289","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45290","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24783","https://errata.almalinux.org/8/ALSA-2024-3346.html","https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2024:2724","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-45288.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2024-3346.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood-technical-details","https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood/","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6886-1","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45288","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644"],"PublishedDate":"2024-04-04T21:15:16.113Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-05-01T18:15:10.493Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"GHSA-m425-mq94-257g","PkgID":"google.golang.org/grpc@v1.54.0","PkgName":"google.golang.org/grpc","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/google.golang.org/grpc@1.54.0","UID":"870b4d25b92a569f"},"InstalledVersion":"1.54.0","FixedVersion":"1.56.3, 1.57.1, 1.58.3","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m425-mq94-257g","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"gRPC-Go HTTP/2 Rapid Reset vulnerability","Description":"### Impact\nIn affected releases of gRPC-Go, it is possible for an attacker to send HTTP/2 requests, cancel them, and send subsequent requests, which is valid by the HTTP/2 protocol, but would cause the gRPC-Go server to launch more concurrent method handlers than the configured maximum stream limit.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability was addressed by #6703 and has been included in patch releases: 1.56.3, 1.57.1, 1.58.3.

When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic.","Severity":"HIGH","CweIDs":["CWE-457"],"VendorSeverity":{"bitnami":3,"cbl-mariner":3,"ghsa":3,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"bitnami":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","V3Score":7.5}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26147","https://github.com/helm/helm","https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/bb4cc9125503a923afb7988f3eb478722a8580af","https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-r53h-jv2g-vpx6","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26147","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26147"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-21T23:15:08.763Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-22T19:07:27.197Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-25210","PkgID":"helm.sh/helm/v3@v3.7.1","PkgName":"helm.sh/helm/v3","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/helm.sh/helm/v3@3.7.1","UID":"12337c778f22b8a5"},"InstalledVersion":"3.7.1","Status":"affected","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2019-25210","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"helm: shows secrets with --dry-run option in clear text","Description":"An issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Helm through 3.13.3.

Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-200"],"VendorSeverity":{"bitnami":2,"cbl-mariner":2,"ghsa":2,"nvd":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"bitnami":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V3Score":4.3},"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V3Score":4.3},"nvd":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V3Score":4.3},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","V3Score":4.3}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25165","https://github.com/helm/helm","https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/293b50c65d4d56187cd4e2f390f0ada46b4c4737","https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/5abcf74227bfe8e5a3dbf105fe62e7b12deb58d2","https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25165","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1547","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25165"],"PublishedDate":"2023-02-08T20:15:24.937Z","LastModifiedDate":"2023-02-16T20:10:18.263Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-25620","PkgID":"helm.sh/helm/v3@v3.7.1","PkgName":"helm.sh/helm/v3","PkgIdentifier":{"PURL":"pkg:golang/helm.sh/helm/v3@3.7.1","UID":"12337c778f22b8a5"},"InstalledVersion":"3.7.1","FixedVersion":"3.14.1","Status":"fixed","Layer":{},"SeveritySource":"ghsa","PrimaryURL":"https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-25620","DataSource":{"ID":"ghsa","Name":"GitHub Security Advisory Go","URL":"https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Ago"},"Title":"helm: Dependency management path traversal","Description":"Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. When either the Helm client or SDK is used to save a chart whose name within the `Chart.yaml` file includes a relative path change, the chart would be saved outside its expected directory based on the changes in the relative path. The validation and linting did not detect the path changes in the name. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.1. Users unable to upgrade should check all charts used by Helm for path changes in their name as found in the `Chart.yaml` file. This includes dependencies.","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-22"],"VendorSeverity":{"bitnami":2,"ghsa":2,"redhat":2},"CVSS":{"bitnami":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","V3Score":6.4},"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","V3Score":6.4},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","V3Score":6.4}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-25620","https://github.com/helm/helm","https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/0d0f91d1ce277b2c8766cdc4c7aa04dbafbf2503","https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.14.1","https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-v53g-5gjp-272r","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25620","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25620"],"PublishedDate":"2024-02-15T00:15:45.347Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-02-15T06:23:39.303Z","Path":"onos-a1t/go.mod"}]
