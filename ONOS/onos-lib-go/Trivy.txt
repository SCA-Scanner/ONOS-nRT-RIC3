An attacker could send a JWE containing compressed data that used large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by Decrypt or DecryptMulti. Those functions now return an error if the decompressed data would exceed 250kB or 10x the compressed size (whichever is larger). This vulnerability has been patched in versions 4.0.1, 3.0.3 and 2.6.3.\n","Severity":"MEDIUM","CweIDs":["CWE-409"],"VendorSeverity":{"alma":2,"cbl-mariner":2,"ghsa":2,"oracle-oval":2,"redhat":2,"rocky":2},"CVSS":{"ghsa":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","V3Score":4.3},"redhat":{"V3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","V3Score":4.3}},"References":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3968","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-28180","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2268820","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2268854","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268017","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268820","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2268854","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45290","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28176","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28180","https://errata.almalinux.org/8/ALSA-2024-3968.html","https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2024:3827","https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose","https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/commit/0dd4dd541c665fb292d664f77604ba694726f298","https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/commit/add6a284ea0f844fd6628cba637be5451fe4b28a","https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/commit/f4c051a0653d78199a053892f7619ebf96339502","https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/security/advisories/GHSA-c5q2-7r4c-mv6g","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2024-28180.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2024-3968.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GD2GSBQTBLYADASUBHHZV2CZPTSLIPQJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GD2GSBQTBLYADASUBHHZV2CZPTSLIPQJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6MMWFBOXJA6ZCXNVPDFJ4XMK5PVG5RG","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6MMWFBOXJA6ZCXNVPDFJ4XMK5PVG5RG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IJ6LAJJ2FTA2JVVOACCV5RZTOIZLXUNJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IJ6LAJJ2FTA2JVVOACCV5RZTOIZLXUNJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JNPMXL36YGS3GQEVI3Q5HKHJ7YAAQXL5","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JNPMXL36YGS3GQEVI3Q5HKHJ7YAAQXL5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KXKGNCRU7OTM5AHC7YIYBNOWI742PRMY","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KXKGNCRU7OTM5AHC7YIYBNOWI742PRMY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MSOMHDKRPU3A2JEMRODT2IREDFBLVPGS","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MSOMHDKRPU3A2JEMRODT2IREDFBLVPGS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UG5FSEYJ3GP27FZXC5YAAMMEC5XWKJHG","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UG5FSEYJ3GP27FZXC5YAAMMEC5XWKJHG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UJO2U5ACZVACNQXJ5EBRFLFW6DP5BROY","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UJO2U5ACZVACNQXJ5EBRFLFW6DP5BROY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XJDO5VSIAOGT2WP63AXAAWNRSVJCNCRH","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XJDO5VSIAOGT2WP63AXAAWNRSVJCNCRH/","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28180","https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28180"],"PublishedDate":"2024-03-09T01:15:07.34Z","LastModifiedDate":"2024-06-12T02:15:09.82Z","Path":"onos-lib-go/go.mod"}]
